# Cohort
A cohort is a group of people who have something in commom.

so we can say: Let's see which month or week our customers came unto our network.

Basically customer aquisition based on weeks or months. This becomes a cohort as what customers have in common is their acqusition date.

This is descriptive analysis.

So there are three types of cohort generally.

1. Time cohort: this describes customers who signed up to a service at a particular time

2. Behavior cohort: this talks about customers who made purchase of a certain product or service in the past

3. Size cohort: this refers to various size of sizes of customers who make purchase of a company's product.

For this project we will work on Time cohort. We will divide our customers on aqusition cohorts this depends on the month they made their first purchase.

We will then assign a cohort index to every purchase history this will show us the number of months since last purchase.

Objectives:
Finding the percentage of active customers compared to the total number of customers after each month:
